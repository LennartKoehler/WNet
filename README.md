# WNet
Open source implementation of the paper [WNet: A Deep Model for Unsupervised Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08506.pdf)

We(Me and @ErwinRussel) tried to reproduce the W-Net paper, as part of the CS4240 Deep Learning course at the TU Delft.

We wrote about our reproduction progress which can be read here: https://aswali.github.io/WNet/

The loss functions implemented are our own.
